"""
Create a function named values that receives a list as an argument and prints all of the items in the list one after the other.

To iterate over a list use the len() function inside the range() function:

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    my_list[i] 
This way, i will iterate from 0 to len(my_list) (not including) which is exactly all of the list indices.
